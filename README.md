# Weather-from-Yahoo
This repository contains the code, which shows weather in the cities. You need to run a file through the server, which called index.html. In the upper rihgt corner you can see navigation menu. It consists of drop-down list and button.
You have to choose the one city in the drop-down list and then click the button.
API from Yahoo! was used for writing this application. Also I use Bootstrap and jQuery with AJAX tehnology.
